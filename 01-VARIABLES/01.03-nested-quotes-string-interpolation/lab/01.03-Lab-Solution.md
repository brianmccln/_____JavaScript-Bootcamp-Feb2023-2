## 01.03 Lab Solution

### ____________________________________________________

Instructions:

- Open **01.03-Lab.html** in your Editor. Write the Lab code in the **script** tags.

1. Debug these strings by mixing-and-matching quotes.

```js
    let cereal = "Cap'n Crunch";
    console.log(cereal); // Cap'n Crunch

    let questi = '"Who\'s there?" she asked.';
    console.log(questi); // "Who's there?" she asked.
```

2. Debug these strings by escaping quotes with backslash:

```js
    let phrase = 'Isn\'t that amazing!';
    console.log(phrase); // Isn't that amazing!

    let quote = "\"Show me the money!\" is a famous movie line.";
    console.log(quote); // "Show me the money!" is a famous movie line.
```

3. Use string interpolation to produce the messages in the comments:

```js
    let pet = 'dog';
    let name = 'Fido';
    let toy = 'frisbee';
    let msg = `My ${pet} ${name}'s favorite toy is a ${toy}.`;
    console.log(msg); // My dog Fidoâ€™s favorite toy is a frisbee.

    let animal;
    let continent;
    let msg = `The ${animal} is native to ${continent}.`;
    console.log(msg); // The kangaroo is native to Australia.
```

4. Produce the restaurant bill output as shown in the multi-line comment, below. This one requires you to combine math operations, which you practiced earlier, with string interpolation:

```js
    let joint = "JS CAFE";
    let food = 30;
    let bev = 20;
    let subTotal = food + bev;
    let taxRate = 0.08; // 8%
    let tipPct = 0.2; // 20%;
    let tax = subTotal * taxRate;
    let tip = subTotal * tipPct;
    let grandTotal = subTotal + tax + tip;
    let guestCheck = `*** ${joint} ***
    *** GUEST CHECK ***
        Food: $${food}
        Beverage: $${bev} 
        Sub-Total: ${subTotal}
        Tax: ${tax}
        Tip: ${tip}
        TOTAL: $${grandTotal}
    *** THANK YOU! ***`;
    console.log(guestCheck);

/*
    *** JS CAFE ***
    *** GUEST CHECK ***
    Food: $30
    Beverage: $20
    Sub-Total: $50
    Tax: $4
    Tip: $10
    TOTAL: $64
    *** THANK YOU! ***
*/
```
