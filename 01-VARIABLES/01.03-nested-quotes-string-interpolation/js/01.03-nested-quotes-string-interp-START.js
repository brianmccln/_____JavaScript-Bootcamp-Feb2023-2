// resoloving nested quotes 
// string interpolation
// const

// resolving conflicting nested quotes 

// Strings can go in either double or single quotes, but nested quotes can cause problems.

// 1. Declare a string in single quotes with an internal single quote (apostrophe). Check the console. There's an error:

// let song = 'Won't Get Fooled Again';
// Unexpected identifier 't'

// An unexpected identifier / unexpected token is a character that doesn't belong. The problem is, the apostrophe was mistaken for the end of the string, which makes 'Won' the entire string. Everything that comes next is 'unexpected'.

// mixing-and-matching quotes
// If you have an inner single quote (apostrophe), avoid conflicts by wrapping the string in double quotes. 

// 2. Resolve the nested quote conflict by switching to double quotes:

let song; // Won't Get Fooled Again

// escaping quotes

// Instead of mixing-and-matching quotes, you can "escape quotes" with a backslash, which causes the punctuation to be ignored.

// 3. Declare another variable with single quotes (apostrophes) nested inside single quotes, and then fix the error by escaping the apostrophes:

// let song2 = 'Don't Stop Believin'';
let song2;

// string interpolation

/* Long string concatenation can get hard to read, with all its quote and plus-signs. A cleaner alternative is "string interpolation" which has no quotes or plus signs. To convert concatenation to interpolation, follow these steps:

- Delete all quotes and plus signs.
- Wrap all in a pair of backticks ` `.
- Wrap each variable in curly braces { }, with a dollar-sign in front: ${variable}.
*/

// 4. Do a string concatenation and then switch to string iterpolation:

// string concatenation
let firstName; 
// Hi, Bob! How are you?

// string iterpolation
greeting;
console.log(greeting); // Hi, Bob! How are you?

// The advantage of string interpolation is more apparent when there are multiple variables and substrings.

// 5. Declare a few more variables and make a longer, more complex concatenation:
let petName;

let catGreeting;

console.log(catGreeting); 
// Meow! My name is Fluffy! I am 3 years old. My favorite food is tuna.

// This concatenation has four pairs of quotes and six plus signs, making it hard to read and write.

// 6. Refactor the above as string interpolation:
catGreeting;
console.log(catGreeting);
// Meow! My name is Fluffy! I am 3 years old. My favorite food is tuna.

// line breaks and tabs

// With string concatenation, hitting enter to get a line break is ignored, as are tabs:

// 7. Do a string concatenation with line breaks and tabs:

let item1;
let shoppingList;
console.log(shoppingList); 
// Shopping List:eggsbreadmilk

// 8. Try it with string interpolation. Now, hitting enter gives you a line break in the output. Tab works too:
shoppingList;
console.log(shoppingList);
/*
Shopping List:
    eggs
    bread
    milk
*/
/*
The line breaks and tabs can be done with regular concatenation: 
- `\n` in string concatenation gives a line break.
- `\t` in string concatenation gives a tabs.

9. Try the shopping list with regular string concatenation, including the line breaks and tabs. It can be done, but is a pain to write, so feel free to copy-paste this one:
*/
shoppingList3;
console.log(shoppingList); 
/*
Shopping List:
    eggs
    bread
    milk
*/

// const means constant
/*
- A **variable** is a named value that can *vary* (change).
- A **constant** is a named value that *cannot* be changed. 

Constants, by convention, have UPPERCASE names, but an all-caps name alone does not make for a constant. Below, `let MOON_DIAMETER` is uppercase, but you can still change the value.
*/

// 10. Declare an uppercase variable with `let`:

let MOON_DIAMETER; 
console.log(MOON_DIAMETER); // 2159.1

// To declare a true constant, use the `const` keyword. As its name implies, `const` makes true constants. If you try to change it, you get an error.

// 11. Declare a true constant with `const`:

// DOZEN = 13; // Error: Assignment to constant variable

// 12. You cannot change a const, so it gives you an error. Comment it out:

// DOZEN = 13;

// 13. Try redeclaring DOZEN as a `var`:

// var DOZEN = 13; // SyntaxError: Identifier DOZEN has already been declared.

// 14. It gives an error, so comment it out:

// var DOZEN = 13;
