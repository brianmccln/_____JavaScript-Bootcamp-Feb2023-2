Instructions:  

- Open **01.04-Lab.html** in your Editor. Write the Lab code in the **script** tags.

1. Set the **y** value to produce console output that matches the comment:

```js
    // Example:
    let x = 20;
    let y;

    // y = ?;
    console.log(x + y); // 23

    // Solution:
    x = 20;
    y = 3; 
    console.log(x + y); // 23

    // On your own:
    x = 10;
    y;

    // y = ?;
    console.log(x + y); // -10

    // y = ?;
    console.log(x - y); // -10

    // y = ?;
    console.log(x * y); // 2.5

    // y = ?;
    console.log(x / y); // 2.5

    // y = ?;
    console.log(x ** y); // 100000

    // y = ?;
    console.log(x % y); // 1

```

2. Calculate the total cost, as shown in the comment:

```js
    let unitCost = 50;
    let numUnits = 12;
    let shipping = 25;
    let totalCost;
    console.log(totalCost); // 625
```

3. Calculate the values of z in terms of w, x and y to get the value shown in the comment:

```js
    let w = 10;
    x = 12;
    y = 15;
    let z;
    console.log(z); // 190
    console.log(z); // 105
    console.log(z); // 18
    console.log(z); // 8
    console.log(z); // 7
```

4. Use the Math Object to generate a random integer between 10-19;

5. Use the Math Object to generate a random integer between 26-50;

6. Use the Math Object to get the maximum value from these numbers: 3, 5, 21, 7, 1, 3, 12, 6

7. Use the Math Object to get the square root of 81.

8. Use a Math Object method that takes 9.9999 as its argument and returns 9.

9. Supply values for x, y and expon so that the console.log output matches the comment next to it:

```js
    x;
    y;
    let expon;
    console.log(expon); // 196
```

10. The area of a circle equals PI times the radius squared: **A = π r²**.  
Given a circle of radius 4, use the Math Object to find the area of the circle.

11. The hypotenuse (c) of a right triangle is obtained by the formula: **a²+b²=c²**, where a and b are the other two sides. Using the Math Object, find the hypotenuse of a triangle, where a=5 and b=12.

12. Generate two random floats, r1 and r2, in the 0-10 range. Round each of them off to 5 decimal places. Add them together. HINTS: You cannot do addition with strings. Use the Number() method to convert strings to numbers.

13. Given this baseball player and his statistics: 

```js
/*
    Player:     Vladimir Guerrero Jr.
    Team:       Toronto Blue Jays
    Year:       2021

    Stats:
    PA: 698    
    AB: 604   
    R:  123   
    H:  188    
    2B: 29     
    3B: 1     
    HR: 48     
    RBI: 111

    Calculate Guerrero's Slugging Percentage (SLG), which equals total bases (TB) divided by at bats (AB): SLG = TB / AB

    Total bases is the sum of a player's hits (H), plus their  doubles (2B), plus twice their triples (3B), plus three times their home runs (HR): TB = H + 2B + (3B * 2) + (HR * 3)

    EXAMPLE:

    A player has 100 hits, including 17 2B, 4 3B and 19 HR: 
    100 + 17 + (4 * 2) + (19 * 3) = 100 + 17 + 8 + 57 = 182 TB

    It took the player 350 AB to amass these 182 TB. Therefore, they have a SLG of: 100/350 = 0.520
