### LOOPS & ARRAYS

1. Write a for loop that makes the following array:
[3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21]


2. Write a for loop that makes the following array:
[100, 80, 60, 40, 20, 0, -20, -40, -60, -80, -100]

3. Given this array of numbers, use a for loop to add up all the numbers. Save the total to a variable, sum.

```js
    const mix = [45, 54, 63, 72, 89, 91, 106];
```

4. Given this array of mixed numbers, 'number-like strings' and fruits, find the sum of the numbers and 'number-like strings'. This requires you to ignore the fruits and to convert the 'number-like strings' to actual numbers.   
Hint: Think Falsey!

```js
    const mix = [”4”, 5, “6”, “apple”, 7, “8”, “kiwi”, 9, 10, “plum”];
```
