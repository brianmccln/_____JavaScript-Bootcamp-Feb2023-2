// selected entries from Glossary of Terms
// An array is a type of object that store data as numbered list items. 
// The syntax is to put the values, which can be of any datatype, inside of square brackets. 
// Items are referenced by their numeric position, known as the **index**, which start numbering at 0.

let fruits = ['kiwi', 'pear', 'plum'];
console.log(fruits[0]); // kiwi

// boolean
// A variable or value that can be only true or false. 
// Conditional logic resolves to a boolean:

let isOnline = true;
isOnline = false;
console.log(isOnline);

// condition

// A condition is something that is evaluated and resolves to true or false. 
// Conditions are found in loops and in if-else statements (conditional logic). 
// The condition of a loop must be true for the loop's code block to execute. 
// In this example, the condition is **x < 10**. 
// If the condition is true, the code inside the {} will run:

let x = 9;
if(x < 10) {
    x++;
}
console.log(x);

// dot syntax
// The use of dots to access or "drill down into" objects is 
// known as dot syntax:

const triStates = {
    ct: {
        nickname: "Constitutino State",
        capitol: "Hartford"
    },
    nj: {
        nickname: "Garden State",
        capitol: "Trenton"
    },
    ny: {
        motnicknameto: "Empire State",
        capitol: "Albany"
    }
}

console.log(triStates.ny.capitol); //  Albany
console.log(triStates.ny); // {nickname: "Empire State", capitol: "Albany"}
console.log(triStates.nj.motto); //  Garden State
console.log(triStates.nj); // {nickname: "Garden State", capitol: "Trenton"}


// else
// Conditional logic is often expressed by if-else statements: 
// if a condition is true, do something; else do something else:

x = 2;
if (x > 3) { 
    console.log('The condition is true!'); 
} else {
    console.log('The condition is false!'); 
}

// for loop

// A for loop executes a block of code again and again, 
// as long as a condition is true. The condition must become 
// false eventually, or else the loop never ends and is called 
// an infinite loop.
// A for loop considers three pieces of information between 
// its parentheses in order to decide if it will run the code 
// inside its curly braces: a counter, a condition and 
// an incrementer:

for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(i*i); // 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100
}

// function
// A function is a block of code that runs only when it is 
// invoked (called). The function can be called in the code 
// or by an event on the web page, such as a button click. 
// A function usually (but not always) has a name to call it by:

function greetUser(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greetUser("Brian"); // Hello, Brian!

// function scope / local scope
// Function scope / local scope refers to variables that are 
// available only inside the function in which they are defined. 
// Also see scope, global scope and local scope.  

// global/ window object
// The highest level object in JS is the global window object, 
// the direct children of which include the document, 
// console, navigation and history objects. The window object 
// is assumed and need not be referenced:

alert("Hello!");
// or:
window.alert("Hello again!");

// global sscope, global memory

// Global scope / memory refers to variables that are 
// declared at the level of the global object and as such 
// are avaialable throughout a script, as opposed to being 
// confined to the scope of a particular code block. 
// Also see scope, function scope and local scope. 
// In this example x is global because it is declared outside 
// of any code block, but i is scoped to the for loop, 
// and so is not available outside the code block. 
// Attempts to reference it result in "ERROR not defined".

x = 5; // global variable

for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

console.log(x); // 5
// console.log(i); // ERROR i is not defined

// history object
// A direct child of the window, the history object has 
// methods pertaining to the browser history. Although the 
// window part is optional, it is customary to include window 
// when referencing the history object:

// reload the last visited browser page
window.history.back();

// if-else logic, if-statement
// The logic of decision making in programming, 
// conditional logic is often expressed by if-else statements: 
// if a condition is true, do something; else do something else:

x = 10;
let y = 3;

if(x > y) { 
    console.log('x is greater than y!'); 
} else {
    console.log('x is equal to or less than y!'); 
}
    
// index
// The position number of an item in an array, 
// with the first item at index 0:

let froots = ['kiwi', 'pear', 'plum'];
console.log(froots[0]); // kiwi

// key
// The name of a property is called the key. 
// This object has keys of name, age and retired:

let guy = { 
    name: "Bob", 
    age: 40, 
    retired: false 
}

// length
// Called on an array, the length property returns the number 
// of items in the array:

let fru = ['kiwi', 'pear', 'plum'];
console.log(fru.length); // 3

// let
// The let keyword is for declaring block-scoped variables, 
// meaning that the variables only exist inside the curly 
// braces in which they are declared. In this example, 
// power is declared in the global scope and so is 
// available everywhere in the script. But i and cube are
// declared inside the for loop, which makes them 
// block scoped, so NOT available in the global scope:

let power = 3;

for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    let cube = i ** power;
    console.log(cube);
}

console.log(power); // 3
// console.log(i); // ERROR cube is not defined
// console.log(cube); // ERROR cube is not defined

// loop
// A loop is a programming routine that executes a block of 
// code again and again, as long as a condition is true. 
// There are a few kinds of loops in JS, including "for loops" 
// and "while loops":

for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(i ** 4); // 1, 16. 81, 625 ... 10000
}

// methods

// Methods are the verbs of programming languages-â€”they do stuff; 
// they perform actions. Just as verbs go together with nouns,
// methods are attached to objects.
// Methods perform a myriad of tasks: output content to html 
// elements, load data from the server, play sounds, create 
// new html elements, and so on.
// Dot-syntax is how we access the methods of a JS object. 
// First comes the object, followed by a dot. Then comes the 
// method. So it goes object-dot-method: 

let dateTime = new Date();
// the Date object's getHours() method: 
let hour = dateTime.getHours();
// the console's log method:
console.log(hour); // integer in 0-23 range

// modulo
// The modulo operator, symbol % returns the remainder when 
// one number is divided by another: 

console.log(15 % 4); // 3

// nesting
// Nesting refers to something inside of another similar thing,
// such as a loop inside of a loop, a block of conditional 
// logic (if-statement inside) conditional logic, or an array 
// inside of an array:

// nested for loop: a loop inside a loop
for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    for(let j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
        console.log(i**j); // i to the j power
    }
}

// nested if-else:
let weather = "cloudy";
let windy = true;

if(weather == "cloudy") {
    console.log("Go to the park");
    if(windy) {
        console.log("Fly a kite");
    } else {
        console.log("Have a picnic");
    }
}

// objects
// Objects are variables that can store more than one value at 
// a time. They are divided broadly into Objects, per se, and a type of object called an Array. Objects proper store data inside curly braces as *properties*, consisting of name-value (key-value) pairs: name: 

let kat = { 
    name: "Fluffy", 
    age: 4, 
    cute: true 
};

// property
// A property is a name-value (key-value pair) that belongs to 
// -- is scoped to -- an object. As such, a property is 
// essentially a local variable. The properties of an object 
// can be nested. Properties are accessed by means od dot 
// syntax: 

let cat = { 
    name: "Fluffy", 
    age: 4, 
    cute: true,
    owner: {
        name: "Bob",
        age: 40,
        job: "Programmer"
    }
}; 
console.log(cat.name); // Fluffy
console.log(cat.owner.name); // Bob
console.log(cat.age); // 4
console.log(cat.owner.age); // 40
console.log(cat.cute); // true
console.log(cat.owner.cute); // undefined
console.log(cat.job); // undefined
console.log(cat.owner.job); // Programmer

// return value
// Think of a function as an input-output machine, with the 
// arguments being the input and the **return** value being 
// the output. A return value "exports" the function result 
// for use elsewhere. In order to "capture" the return value, 
// set the function call equal to a variable:

function addNums(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

let sum1 = addNums(5, 6);
console.log(sum1); // 11

let sum2 = addNums(8, 9);
console.log(sum2); // 17

// string
// Pure text in quotes is a string. Setting a variable equal 
// to a string gives the variable a data type of string:

let firstName = "Brian";
    console.log(firstName, typeof(firstName)); // Brian string

// ternary
// A ternary expression is a concise, one-line alternative to 
// an else-if statement. It uses ? and : instead of if() 
// and else, while also dispensing with the curly braces:

Â x = 5;

// if x is less than 10, add 1; else set x equal to 0:
if(x < 10) {
    x++;
} else {
    x = 0;
}

// ternary version of the above:
x < 10 ? x++ : x = 0;

// var
// The var keyword for declaring variables has largely been 
// supplanted by let due to the greater control over variable 
// scope provided by the latter. A var declared inside the 
// curly braces of a loop or if-statement are in the global 
// scope, whereas let variables declared inside the curly 
// braces of a loop or if-statement are scoped to that code 
// block:

// j exists outside the loop, because it is declared with var:
for(var j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
    console.log(j**2); // j squared
}
console.log(j); // 5

// i exists ONLY inside the loop, because it is declared with let:
for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i**2); // i squared
}
// console.log(i); // ERROR: i is not undefined

// while
// A while loop is a kind of loop. Unlike a for loop, 
// which has the counter, condition and incrementer inside 
// parentheses, a while loop has these elements scattered 
// about, with the counter declared above the loop, the 
// conditon evaluated inside parentheses, and the incrementer 
// inside the curly braces. In general, use a for loop if you 
// know exactly how many times you want the loop to run, and 
// use a while loop if the number of iterations is not 
// pre-determined:

let frutes = ['apple', 'banana', 'grape', 'kiwi', 'orange', 'pear'];

// using a for loop, because the number of iterations is known:
for(let i = 0; i < frutes.length; i++) {
    console.log(frutes[i] + " has " + frutes[i].length + " letters!");
}

// using a while loop because the number of iterations is not 
// known; the loop ends with the first 4-letter item, but its 
// index may not be known.

let n = 0;
while (frutes[n].length != 4) {
    console.log(frutes[n] + " is " + frutes[n].length + " letters long!");
    n++;
}

/* the for loop will run 6 times as it fully traverses the array, but the while loop will only run 3 times, because it will quit when the condition is false, which occurs when the current item is 'kiwi'.
apple has 5 letters!
banana has 6 letters!
grape has 5 letters!
kiwi has 4 letters!
orange has 6 letters!
pear has 4 letters!
apple is 5 letters long!
banana is 6 letters long!
grape is 5 letters long!
