**anonymous function**

A function without a name is called an *anonymous function*. These occur when the function code is written in-line or set equal to an event, as opposed to as a separate location that must be referenced by name. Example of anonymous function: 

```js
    myButton.onclick = function() { 
        alert('You clicked the button!'); 
    };  

    // or:
    myButton.addEventListener('click', function() { 
        alert('You clicked the button!'); 
    });
```

Also see **function**

**argument / parameter**

- Data that goes between the parentheses of a method or a function is called an **argument**.
- When the function is defined, the data in the parentheses, known as **parameter(s)** is defined as a variable.
- When the function is called, an argument is passed into the parentheses. In this way, the argument sets the value of the parameter, 

```js
    function greetUser(name) {
        console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
    }
    greetUser("Brian"); // Hello, Brian!
```

**array** 

An array is a type of **object** that store data as numbered list items. The syntax is to put the values, which can be of any datatype, inside of square brackets. Items are referenced by their numeric position, known as the **index**, which start numbering at 0.

```js
    let fruits = ['kiwi', 'pear', 'plum'];
    console.log(fruits[0]); // kiwi
```

 Also see **index**, **object**.

**assignment operator**

The equals sign **=** is known as the *assignment operator*, because it assigns or sets a value: **x = 5** assigns **5** as the value of **x**.

```js
    let x = 8;
    x = 9;
```

**asynchronous**

The term **asynchronous** (async, for short) refers to code being executed at different times, particularly due to delays in data being made available as in a server request. One function makes a request for data from a server, and another function must asynchronously wait for that data to load and be made available. Callback functions are used to handle asynchronous requests.

**block scope** 

Block refers to variables that are avaialable only within the particular code block in which they are declared, as defined by a pair of curly braces { }. Also see *scope*, *function scope* and *global scope*.  
The rules for **variable scope**:  
    - variables not declared inside any {} are **global**, which means they are available everywhere in the script.  
    - **let** and **const** declared inside {} are **block scoped**, which means they are available only inside that code block.  
    - **var** declared inside {} are **global** (unless the {} is a function)  
    - Any variable declared inside a function is available only to that function. These are known as **local variables** or **function-scoped variables**.  

**boolean**

A variable or value that can be only *true* or *false*. Conditional logic resolves to a boolean:

```js
    let isOnline = true;
    isOnline = false;
```

**condition**

A condition is something that is evaluated and resolves to *true* or *false*. Conditions are found in loops and in if-else statements (conditional logic). The condition of a loop must be true for the loop's code block to execute. In this example, the condition is **x < 10**. If the condition is true, the code inside the {} will run:

```js
    let x = 9;
    if(x < 10) {
        x++;
    }
```

**console**

The *console* is a browser debugging environment where you can output code via the command. The following would produce output of `25` in the console, which may be accessed via Dev Tools or Inspect > Console: `let x = 5; console.log(x * x); // 25`.

**const** 

The `const` keyword for declaring primitive variables (string, number, boolean) prevents them from being changed. Objects declared with `const` can have their properties and items changed by cannot have their data type changed.

**counter variable**

A variable that exists to keep count of something. Loops rely on counter variables to be incremented or decremneted with each iteration of the loop so that the condition driving the loop can ultimately become false and the loop can therefore stop.

**document**

The webpage, a child object of the Window. JS "sees" the document and all of its elements as a hierarchy of so many nested objects, which JS can manipulate in a myriad of ways.

**dot syntax**

The use of dots to access or "drill down into" objects is known as dot syntax. In this example, **triStates.ny.capitol** returns the value of the **capitol** property, "Albany", which is a child of the **ny** property, itself an object, which is a child of the **triStates** object:

```js
    const triStates = {
        ct: {
            nickname: "Constitutino State",
            capitol: "Hartford"
        },
        nj: {
            nickname: "Garden State",
            capitol: "Trenton"
        },
        ny: {
            motnicknameto: "Empire State",
            capitol: "Albany"
        }
    }

    console.log(triStates.ny.capitol); //  Albany
    console.log(triStates.ny); // {nickname: "Empire State", capitol: "Albany"}
    console.log(triStates.nj.motto); //  Garden State
    console.log(triStates.nj); // {nickname: "Garden State", capitol: "Trenton"}
```

**else**

Conditional logic is often expressed by if-else statements: if a condition is true, do something; **else** do something else:

```js
    let x = 2;
    if (x > 3) { 
        console.log('The condition is true!'); 
    } else {
        console.log('The condition is false!'); 
    }
```

Also see *if-else logic*.

**event**

An **event** is something that happens during the running of an application. Events are often used as triggers to call functions. Common events include **click** and **change**:

```
    myButton.addEventListener('click', doSomething); 
    mySelectMenu.addEventListener('change', doSomethingElse);
```

**for loop**

A for loop executes a block of code again and again, as long as a condition is true. The condition must become false eventually, or else the loop never ends and is called an *infinite loop*.
A for loop considers three pieces of information between its parentheses in order to decide if it will run the code inside its curly braces: a **counter**, a **condition** and an **incrementer**:

```js
    for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        console.log(i*i); // 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100
    }
```

**function**

A function is a block of code that runs only when it is invoked (called). The function can be called in the code or by an event on the web page, such as a button click. A function usually (but not always) has a name to call it by:

```js
    function greetUser(name) {
        console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
    }

    greetUser("Brian"); // Hello, Brian!
    myButton.addEventListener('click', greetUser); 
```

**function scope / local scope**  

Function scope / local scope refers to variables that are available only inside the function in which they are defined. Also see *scope*, *global scope* and *local scope*.  

**global/ window object**

The highest level object in JS is the *global window object*, the direct children of which include the *document*, *console*, *navigation* and *history* objects. The window object is assumed and need not be referenced:

```js
    alert("Hello!");
    // or:
    window.alert("Hello again!");
```

**global sscope, global memory**

Global scope / memory refers to variables that are declared at the level of the *global object* and as such are avaialable throughout a script, as opposed to being confined to the scope of a particular code block. Also see *scope*, *function scope* and *local scope*. In this example **x** is global because it is declared outside of any code block, but **i** is scoped to the for loop, and so is *not* available outside the code block. Attempts to reference it result in **ERROR not defined**.

```js
    let x = 5; // global variable

    for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        console.log(i);
    }

    console.log(x); // 5
    console.log(i); // ERROR i is not defined
```

**history object**

A direct child of the window, the *history object* has methods pertaining to the browser history. Although the *window* part is optional, it is customary to include window when referencing the history object:

```js
    // reload the last visited browser page
    window.history.back(); 
```


**if-else logic, if-statement**

The logic of decision making in programming, conditional logic is often expressed by if-else statements: if a condition is true, do something; else do something else:

```js
    let x = 10;
    let y = 3;

    if(x > y) { 
        console.log('x is greater than y!'); 
    } else {
        console.log('x is equal to or less than y!'); 
    }
```
    
Also see *conditional logic*.

**index**

The position number of an item in an array, with the first item at index 0:

```js
    let fruits = ['kiwi', 'pear', 'plum'];
    console.log(fruits[0]); // kiwi
```

**key**

The name of a property is called the *key*. This object has keys of **name**, **age** and **retired**.

```js
    let guy = { 
        name: "Bob", 
        age: 40, 
        retired: false 
    } 
```

**length**

Called on an array, the *length* property returns the number of items in the array:

```js
    let fruits = ['kiwi', 'pear', 'plum'];
    console.log(fruits.length); // 3
```

**let**

The **let** keyword is for declaring block-scoped variables, meaning that the variables only exist inside the curly braces in which they are declared. In this example, **power** is declared in the **global scope** and so is available everywhere in the script. But **i** and **cube** are declared inside the for loop, which makes them **block scoped** variables, so NOT available in the global scope:

```js
    let power = 3;

    for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        let cube = i ** power;
        console.log(cube);
    }

    console.log(power); // 3
    console.log(i); // ERROR cube is not defined
    console.log(cube); // ERROR cube is not defined
```

**loop**

A loop is a programming routine that executes a block of code again and again, as long as a condition is true. There are a few kinds of loops in JS, including "for loops" and "while loops":

```js
    for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        console.log(i ** 4); // 1, 16. 81, 625 ... 10000
    }
```

**methods**

Methods are the verbs of programming languages-—they do stuff; they perform actions. Just as verbs go together with nouns, methods are attached to objects.
- Methods perform a myriad of tasks: output content to html elements, load data from the server, play sounds, create new html elements, and so on.
- Dot-syntax is how we access the methods of a JS object. First comes the object, followed by a dot. Then comes the method. So it goes object-dot-method: 

```js
    let dateTime = new Date();
    // the Date object's getHours() method: 
    let hour = dateTime.getHours();
    // the console's log method:
    console.log(hour); // integer in 0-23 range
```

**modulo**

The *modulo operator*, symbol `%` returns the remainder when one number is divided by another: 

```js
    console.log(15 % 4); // 3
```

**nesting**

Nesting refers to something inside of another similar thing, such as a loop inside of a loop, a block of conditional logic (if-statement inside) conditional logic, or an array inside of an array:

```js
    // nested for loop: a loop inside a loop
    for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        for(let j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            console.log(i**j); // i to the j power
        }
    }

    // nested if-else:
    let weather = "cloudy";
    let windy = true;

    if(weather == "cloudy") {
        console.log("Go to the park");
        if(windy) {
            console.log("Fly a kite");
        } else {
            console.log("Have a picnic");
        }
    }
```

**objects**

Objects are variables that can store more than one value at a time. They are divided broadly into Objects, per se, and a type of object called an Array. Objects proper store data inside curly braces as *properties*, consisting of name-value (key-value) pairs: name: 

```js
    let cat = { 
        name: "Fluffy", 
        age: 4, 
        cute: true 
    };
```

**property**

A property is a name-value (key-value pair) that belongs to -- is scoped to -- an object. As such, a property is essentially a local variable. The properties of an object can be nested. Properties are accessed by means od **dot syntax**: 

```js
    let cat = { 
        name: "Fluffy", 
        age: 4, 
        cute: true,
        owner: {
            name: "Bob",
            age: 40,
            job: "Programmer"
        }
    }; 
    console.log(cat.name); // Fluffy
    console.log(cat.owner.name); // Bob
    console.log(cat.age); // 4
    console.log(cat.owner.age); // 40
    console.log(cat.cute); // true
    console.log(cat.owner.cute); // undefined
    console.log(cat.job); // undefined
    console.log(cat.owner.job); // Programmer
```

**return value**

Think of a function as an input-output machine, with the arguments being the input and the **return** value being the output. A **return** value "exports" the function result for use elsewhere. In order to "capture" the return value, set the function call equal to a variable:

```js
    function addNums(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    let sum1 = addNums(5, 6);
    console.log(sum1); // 11

    let sum2 = addNums(8, 9);
    console.log(sum2); // 17
```

**string**

Pure text in quotes is a string. Setting a variable equal to a string gives the variable a data type of **string**:

```js
    let firstName = "Brian";
    console.log(firstName, typeof(firstName)); // Brian string
```

**ternary**

A ternary expression is a concise, one-line alternative to an else-if statement. It uses **?** and **:** instead of **if()** and **else**, while also dispensing with the curly braces:

```js
    let x = 5;

    // if x is less than 10, add 1; else set x equal to 0:
    if(x < 10) {
        x++;
    } else {
        x = 0;
    }

    // ternary version of the above:
    x < 10 ? x++ : x = 0;
```

**this**

The this keyword refers to various objects, depending on where it is encountered:  
- in the global scope, *this* is the Global Window Object  
- inside a function, *this* is the object (button, menu, etc) whose event ('click', 'change', etc) called the function.  
- in a function defined inside an object (a method), *this* refers to the object itself.  

 **var**

The `var` keyword for declaring variables has largely been supplanted by `let` due to the greater control over variable scope provided by the latter. A `var` declared inside the curly braces of a loop or if-statement are in the global scope, whereas `let` variables declared inside the curly braces of a loop or if-statement are scoped to that code block:

```js
    // j exists outside the loop, because it is declared with var:
    for(var j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
        console.log(j**2); // j squared
    }
    console.log(j); // 5

    // i exists ONLY inside the loop, because it is declared with let:
    for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        console.log(i**2); // i squared
    }
    console.log(i); // ERROR: i is not undefined
```

**while**

A **while loop** is a kind of loop. Unlike a **for loop**, which has the counter, condition and incrementer inside parentheses, a while loop has these elements scattered about, with the counter declared above the loop, the conditon evaluated inside parentheses, and the incrementer inside the curly braces. In general, use a for loop if you know exactly how many times you want the loop to run, and use a while loop if the number of iterations is not pre-determined:

```js
    let frutes = ['apple', 'banana', 'grape', 'kiwi', 'orange', 'pear'];

    // using a for loop, because the number of iterations is known:
    for(let i = 0; i < frutes.length; i++) {
        console.log(frutes[i] + " has " + frutes[i].length + " letters!");
    }

    /* using a while loop because the number of iterations is not known; the loop ends with the first 4-letter item, but its index may not be known. */

    let n = 0;
    while (frutes[n].length != 4) {
        console.log(frutes[n] + " is " + frutes[n].length + " letters long!");
        n++;
    }

    /* the for loop will run 6 times as it fully traverses the array, but the while loop will only run 3 times, because it will quit when the condition is false, which occurs when the current item is 'kiwi'.
    apple has 5 letters!
    banana has 6 letters!
    grape has 5 letters!
    kiwi has 4 letters!
    orange has 6 letters!
    pear has 4 letters!
    apple is 5 letters long!
    banana is 6 letters long!
    grape is 5 letters long!
    */
```

**window**

- The Javascript Window object is the top-level "thing" in html: it is above the document (web page) itself.
